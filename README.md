This fork of [Crowdsource Reporter](https://github.com/Esri/crowdsource-reporter) is an example "migration" of a traditional Dojo/JSAPI application to use a more modern tooling stack. I added in ES6 (including modules), Webpack, ESLint, Babel, and a few other goodies.

[Head here](https://geonet.esri.com/people/jpeterson-esristaff/blog/2017/03/07/how-to-tame-your-web-app-the-plan) for the first post in a companion blog series where I share my experiences.

This project came about in prep for a technical session at the 2017 Esri International Developer Summit - you can find more about that session [here](https://github.com/jpeterson/devsummit-2017-modern-tools/blob/master/README.md).
